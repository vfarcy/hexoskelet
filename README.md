============================

This repository holds my blog which you can visit at vfarcy.github.io/hexoskelet.

You can type `npm install` at the prompt.

The blog is compiled by `hexo generate` and deployed on GitHub by `hexo deploy`. 

The sources of the blog pages are markdown documents. The pages are stored in the `source` directory (within the master branch). At the compilation phase, html documents are generated and stored within the gh-pages/ branch.

`_config.yml` is a configuration file.
