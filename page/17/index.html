    	<p>Sometime, cartoons explain the world we  live in better than the news we listen to !</p>
<p>Did you hear about the bailouts?</p>
<ul>
<li>No. What about the bailouts?<br>The government has announced the taxpayers will make money on the bailouts.</li>
<li>Should I believe them?<br>Depends. Do you believe the politicians are honest?</li>
<li>No.<br>Do you believe the bankers are fair?</li>
<li>No.<br>Do you believe that the 2 plus 2 equals pink?</li>
<li>No. I definitely do not believe that the 2 plus 2 equals pink.<br>Than you should not believe we’ll make money on the bailouts.</li>
<li>But how could the government claim such a thing?<br>By conveniently ignoring the backdoor bailouts.</li>
<li>What is a backdoor bailout?<br>A backdoor bailout is like any other bailout, except the government lies and say it wasn’t a bailout.</li>
<li>But what was the main bailout?<br>The main bailout was the tar-pee program.</li>
<li>What is the tar-pee program?<br>A program where the government used the taxpayer dollars to buy the shares in the banks.</li>
<li>Why did they buy the shares?<br>Because they said the banks were too big to fail, and if they failed,there would be too many foreclosures and no new mortgages.</li>
<li>So after the government bought the shares, did the banks stop the foreclosures?<br>No.</li>
<li>Did they give the mortgages?<br>No.</li>
<li>So what did they do with the money?<br>They used it to buy other banks.</li>
<li>But werent they already too big to fail?<br>Yes.</li>
<li>So now they are too biggerer to fail?<br>Exactly.</li>
<li>Which banks are too biggerer to fail?<br>The biggest are the JP Morgan Chase Bear Sterns Washington Mutual,and the Bank of America Countrywide Merill Lynch.</li>
<li>What about the Goldman Sachs. Did they buy another bank?<br>No.</li>
<li>Why not?<br>Because when you already own the US government, you don’t need to buy any more banks.</li>
<li>After the other banks became too biggerer to fail, did they stop the foreclosures?<br>No</li>
<li>Did they give the mortgages?<br>No</li>
<li>Did they do anything at all?<br>One executive at the bank of America countrywide merill lynch paid the bill on his 70 thousand dollar desk.</li>
<li>My god. Is this a corrupt third world country?<br>Definitely not.</li>
<li>How could you be so sure?<br>Because nobody in a third world country would be stupid enough to spend 70 thousand dollars on a desk.</li>
<li>Is this executive still at the bank of America Countrywide Merill<br>Lynch?<br>No. He is now the CEO of the C I T.</li>
<li>What is the C I T ?<br>The C I T is a failed lending company.</li>
<li>How could a failed company hire a new CEO?<br>Because they also got billions in the bailouts.</li>
<li>Do these people have no shame?<br>When you constantly get the bailouts, you don’t care about the shame.</li>
<li>What was the main backdoor bailout?<br>The biggest was the bailout of the AIGs.</li>
<li>Why did they bailout the AIGs?<br>Because the AIGs owed billions to the banks, and if they went under the banks would lose too much money.</li>
<li>And after the bailout, how much did the banks lose?<br>Nothing</li>
<li>How is that possible?<br>Because the government decided the taxpayers should pay for all the banks mistakes</li>
<li>Which bank did the AIGs owe the most money to?<br>The Goldman Sachs.</li>
<li>So despite its poor decision to do too much business with a failed company, the Goldman Sachs did not lose a penny?<br>Actually, the Goldman Sachs probably profited from the failure of the AIGs.</li>
<li>How could someone profit from the downfall of one of their biggest business partners?<br>Because while the Goldman Sachs was working with the AIGs, it was also making a secret bet that they would go under.</li>
<li>My god, is this some kind of science fiction movie, like the star wars?<br>No.</li>
<li>How do you know?<br>Because the evil empire in the star wars was fiction. But the evil empire that is the Goldman Sachs is very real.</li>
<li>But weren’t the American people outraged by this manipulation of a bailout?<br>At the time, the American people did not know about the structure of this bailout.</li>
<li>How come?<br>Because the government ordered the AIGs to lie to the people.</li>
<li>Who in the government gave such an order?<br>The New York Fed.</li>
<li>And who at the time was in charge of the New York Fed?<br>The Timothy Geithner.</li>
<li>And who put the Timothy Geithner in charge?<br>The Timothy Geithner was appointed by the President Bush.</li>
<li>What about the President Obama, and the change. Did the President Obama bring the change to the Timothy Geithner?<br>Yes</li>
<li>So he fired him?<br>No. He promoted him to treasury secretary.</li>
<li>That does not sound like the change we can believe in.<br>Definitely not.</li>
<li>Were there any other bailouts?<br>Yes. During the financial crisis, the Ben Bernank loaned trillons of dollars to companies like the barclays.</li>
<li>What is the Barclays?<br>The barclays is a european bank.</li>
<li>Why would the Ben Bernank lend money to a European bank?<br>So they could buy the Lehman after it went bankrupt.</li>
<li>And why did the Lehman go bankrupt?<br>Because the Ben Bernank refused to lend them any money.</li>
<li>But why would the fed refuse to lend the American peoples money to an American bank, but then lend the money to a european bank?<br>I dont know, maybe because the Europeans have funny accents.</li>
<li>But me and you also have funny accents. will the Ben Bernanke lend us money?<br>No</li>
<li>Why not?<br>Because we are not bankers, and to the Ben Bernank if you are not a banker, then you simply don’t exist.</li>
<li>So after all these bailouts, did the banks stop the foreclosures?<br>No.</li>
<li>Did they give the mortgages?<br>No.</li>
<li>Did they do anything at all?<br>They paid themselves big bonuses.</li>
<li>That does not sound like a prudent use of the American peoples money.<br>When you constantly get the bailouts, you don’t care about the<br>prudence.</li>
<li>Are any of the bailouts going on today?<br>Yes. The Ben Bernanke keeps the short term interest rates at zero.</li>
<li>How is that a bailout?<br>Low rates mean the banks have to pay the American people very little interest in their savings accounts.</li>
<li>That is a very nice gift from the American people to the banks.<br>Yes.</li>
<li>And to show their gratitute, did the banks stop the foreclosures?<br>No</li>
<li>Did they give the mortgages?<br>No.</li>
<li>Did they do anything at all?<br>Yes. They increased the monthly fees on all bank accounts.</li>
<li>That does not sound like the gratitude. That sounds like the screwing of the American people.<br>Yes.</li>
<li>But isn’t it normally a bad idea to screw your own customers?<br>When you constantly get the bailouts, you don’t care about your customers.</li>
<li>But after all these different bailouts, what did the banks do<br>with the money?<br>They invested a lot of it in the foreign countries.</li>
<li>Why did they invest in the foreign countries?<br>Because they said in America the taxes are too high.</li>
<li>Why are the taxes so high?<br>Because the government is broke.</li>
<li>And why is the government broke?<br>Because they spent all their money on the bailouts.</li>
<li>Is this all some kind of a sick joke?<br>Yes, in a way, it is.</li>
<li>What kind of joke is it?<br>Well, do you work for a bank?</li>
<li>No.<br>Did you get any of the bailouts?</li>
<li>No.<br>Do you pay income taxes?</li>
<li>Yes.<br>Then the joke is on you.</li>
