Back to the blog today, I did some maintenance by installing a new feature that allows me to write in Markdown from draftin.com and to publish in one click.

Markdown

This page has been created by entering Markdown in a simple format that&#39;s easy to read and write. Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.

As [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/) writes on the [Markdown site](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/):

> The overriding design goal for Markdown&#39;s
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable 
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it&#39;s been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

Draft

Draft is not only a distraction free online text editor that provides amazing functionalities such as versionning, team collaboration and transcription tools, all together in a sleak environment. It also features a special editing mode which is called &quot;Hemingway mode&quot;. 

&quot;Hemingway mode&quot; is about being focused on writing, by turning off the ability to delete anything in your document. In this mode, you can only go forward. You can&#39;t go backward. You know, editing and writing are two very different functions and one shouldn&#39;t pollute the other. It&#39;s difficult to write if you&#39;re in a editing mindset and removing more words than you&#39;re putting on the page.
