Do you know what ?

The word “same” seems perfectly clear until you give it some thought, and then you realize there is more to it than you expected. For example, if you say, “Chris and I have the same car,” you mean that his car and yours are the same make and model, but that they are two diﬀerent cars.

If you say, “Chris and I have the same mother,” you mean that his mother and yours are the same person.1 So the idea of “sameness” is diﬀerent depending on the context.
