## Using this tool

This page lets you create HTML by entering text in a simple format that&#39;s easy to read and write.

*   Type Markdown text in the left window
*   See the HTML in the right

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/) writes on the [Markdown site](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/):

> The overriding design goal for Markdown&#39;s
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable 
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it&#39;s been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This document is written in Markdown; you can see the plain-text version on the left.  To get a feel for Markdown&#39;s syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.  You can see a Markdown syntax guide by switching the right-hand window from _Preview_ to _Syntax Guide_.

Showdown is a Javascript port of Markdown.  You can get the full [source code](http://www.attacklab.net/showdown-v0.9.zip) by clicking on the version number at the bottom of the page.
