What we know today about jogging, or running, is the result of about one century of experience, comments , studies and thoughts of runners, coaches and trainers from all around the world.

They all have trained for becoming better than others, often by committing themselves big mistakes. To make it simple, we have learned from the past.

In that domain, medicine, exercise physiology, dietetic, nutrition are valuable assets. All this may seem very complicated, especially because rational or common sense are often disappointing and misleading. Common sense is a trap that we must keep away.

Today, how does a jogger who wants to run for fun start ?

Beginner and isolated, he may apply what seems logical, which is almost always false : running to fast, running to soon, running too much, feeling exhausted.

As a result, he will stop running in one month. I am wrong ?

Today, I know from my personal experience that efficiency training is actually simple. A couple of things I remember though are how I felt four years ago, asking myself :

*   **How to optimise my available time, considering running, my job and my family ?**
*   **What are the mistakes every beginner does ?**
*   Is it safe starting running at 40 ?
*   How to keep free from injuries?
*   How to stretch ?
*   How long to run, how often, how fast ?
*   What about my running equipment ? How to dress up running in the rain, in the sun ?
*   What books are the best to read ?
*   How to record my workout ?
*   How to stay motivated ?
I answered those questions, and many more that came out later.

I invented nothing.

For 3 years, while preparing the marathon (actually, when I started running I didn’t know I will run the marathon one day ) I asked questions online, browsed the web, subscribed to magazines, listened to podcast, watched videos and **knew about myself**.

I’m definitely not a Guru. I just tried, tested, checked out, what other people did. I also simplified what other people complicated, sometime to make it incomprehensible, sometimes because they didn’t even understand themselves !

My only contribution today is to explain in a very simple way, using simple words (that’s great, I’m not a native english writer !), to be as much precise and concrete as possible, to be understood by the greatest number, and to **tell you what i have learned.**
