[![How to change bad habits](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1047/667939129_1b0e3fb077_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17235062@N00/667939129)Are you overweight ? Do you eat junk food ? Do you feel tired ? Do you smoke ?

Why not starting a new life and getting fit ?

It&#8217;s possible. I did it four years ago.  I made a deal with myself, and made the decision to **change my unhealthy eating habits **and to focus on developing my ability **to support a moderate effort for a long time**. I knew it was the beginning of a long journey.

I will tell you how I did so that you can succeed too.

Here is how you can change your unhealthy eating habits :

If you have fallen into the junk food trap, you should know that eating junk food gives you an instant positive feedback. Right away, you are rewarded by the taste, bringing to you an extreme satisfaction. Unfortunately, you don&#8217;t feel the negative consequences of your unhealthy eating habits until much later.

You have to start to study about ending your unhealthy food addiction and gradually replace that addiction with simple positive behaviours. You will soon become more conscious of the urge you have to lose weight and why you haven&#8217;t done it before. Once you will become more aware, you will be willing to fix the root problems.

Here is what I did &#8211; simple positive behaviours :

*   I drank water every time I felt hungry
*   I stopped eating fatty and salty meals  (I ate veggies, white meats, fishes, whole wheat bread, fruits)
*   I increased my daily walk (I walked my dogs and got off the metro two stations before I should)

Thus, you will be losing some weight.

Then, develop your ability to support a moderate effort for a long time, your endurance.

Start jogging, remember yourself that the most important thing is to get into the habit of moving on again. Walk for the first and last minutes of your workout to warm up, keep the same amount of exercise compared to the time you walked, and gradually increase the intensity. Add into each walking session some jogging fractions, **at a very low-speed and **lengthen  then run portions, cut the walk portions so that you eventually jog for 30 minutes in total ease breathing. Walk at a good pace during the first few minutes, and then  jog. Open your mouth wide to breathe easily, without straining, being at full ease while running. **As soon as this good feeling leaves you, pull down yourself, and walk again so that your heart frequency always stays below an upper limit **(we will determine that limit later). What matters is **exercising duration, not speed**. Eventually, don&#8217;t forget to stretch at the end of exercising. Drink water, the best beverage you have never drunk.

That&#8217;s exactly what I did, weeks after weeks, months after months. I achieved very important steps, carefully, without doing too much, being regular and avoiding a strong contrast between my new physical activity and my earlier sedentary life. I continued to change my eating habits, eating right foods, not too much sugar, not too much fat, vegetables, white meat and fish.

As a conclusion, if I could offer you one trip, it would be this :

1.  Stay focus, find your instant positive feedback, replaced it with simple positive behaviours, change you unhealthy eating habits
2.  Develop your endurance, do not try to do more, even if you feel you can. If you push to hard, you may be going faster for a week or two, but you could get hurt and possibly penalized yourself for weeks. Although your physical condition would allow you to probably do more, do not. Your muscles are not trained enough to this new kind of effort now.

Are you ready to make the deal ? Are you convinced you too can succeed ?
