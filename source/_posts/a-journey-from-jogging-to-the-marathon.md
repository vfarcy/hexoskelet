Running is not for you, is it ?

It's so hard, tedious, tiring and uninteresting that you believe that you have nothing to do in losing time in this field.

However, suppose that you would like to move on, to recover from a loss shape. What could you do ?

I asked myself this question , 4 years ago.

I then started running, 10 minutes, it was hard, then 20 minutes, then 45, then 1 hour, then 5 km, then 10km, then half a marathon.

I then asked myself "why do I run ?"

The temptation to lengthen the distance had been emerged. Did it make sense? Wasn't it too much? Was I capable?

To get the answer, I decided to train for my first Marathon. I was 43.

In April 2010, I took the departure of the Paris Marathon and I crossed the line with extreme emotion, in an explosion of joy. I succeeded, and was ready to start again, as 100 000 people in France each year.

I would like to share with you this wonderful experience and guide you through the first steps. It is just about applying simple well-known things and proven recipes, so many things I have collected, tested and applied successfully. I searched, read and listened. I can help you save your time, avoid any inconvenience, injury, exhaustion, while maintaining your motivation toward the goal.
