Mister Google, I have been using your Google's Nexus 7 tablet for one month now.

Many things have been written about your fantastic device. It is a perfect, low-cost, rugged, easy tablet that works for the whole family. So, I won't write more about your tablet's technical specifications, how it is the perfect device to travel with, well priced, how it fits very well in hand,the 7" form factor being the perfect size for nomadic life and work. Your hardware really rocks and your open ecosystem realy fits my way of thinking. So open, but so huge too;I'm sometimes not comfortable with how big you are, even if you pretend  that you are not evil.

Mister Apple, I'm definitely not a fan boy. I feel concerned about your products being produced at low-cost in China, regarding the money I have to spend to acquire it. But honestly, I recognize that I have been satisfied with your IOS mobile phone. I own an old 4S, the first  Apple product I purchased after discussing it a long time with friends of mine whore are among Apple's early adopters. They convinced me of the simplicity of your products that simply do their job as I expect them to. I finally decided to buy your mobile phone. Months latter, I didn't upgrade to the Iphone 5\. I don't regret my initial choice which suits my needs,even if some days I'm not really comfortable with the closed nature of your ecosystem. When in doubt, I tell myself it's probably the cost to pay to have a device than hasn't crashed once since I got it, wich never happened to your competitor's products.

The Nexus 7, alone, works fine, the iPhone as well.

By the way, my point here, Misters, is to share an issue I encounter since I use my Nexus 7 connected  to my Iphone 4 via a bluetooth connexion.

Larry and Tim, I know that you in a strong competition to bringing your customers the best experience while developping yourselves. I have activated the bluetooth tether mode on the Nexus  and the Hotspot functionality on the iPhone, and the truth is that it seems that your two devices don't work well together.

I struggle hard to reproduce the bug, but I think I eventually succeeded today while [co-working @lacantine](http://lacantine.org/blog/un-espace-de-coworking "I"). So, please take a few seconds to consider this.Here I go :

I have discovered that the Nexus 7 bugs when it is connected to the Internet through the iPhone's 3G connexion. The things only happen if the iPhone loses its internet connexion. In such a situation, the Nexus 7 suddenly disconnected from the internet of course, returns to the login screen and I have to enter the password again and again, sometimes 3 times or more. Sometimes, I even have to reboot the tablet to continue the work I was doing before the iPhone lost its 3G signal. The bug isn't reproduced if I turn the connexion off, which makes me think I have identified the root cause of the bug.

I don't know if I am the only one to connect the Nexus 7 with an iPhone 4 over Bluetooth and would be more than happy if you could fix what makes your two devices not function correctly when linked to each other.

Kind regards,
