I'm very happy to see engineering school encouraging entrepreneurship. I regularly meet students on the verge of developing their own business. Most of the time, they have an idea and worry about investment, focus on technical issues, struggle to find a place to work, write code in their garage or build things in their cellar.

I often raise their awareness regarding customer and product development, something they are not always accustomed to. AlthoughÂ the long-term benefits have not yet been proved by scientists, it seems like natural to them that bringing a unique solution to someone else's problem is kind of valuable help. I sum it up that way :

*   Identify your perfect customers, focus on them and on nothing else, stop writing code, talk to them first.
*   Make investors feel like the rocket is taking of, with or without them. Investment isn't success.
*   Talk about your idea, spread it around the world and thrive on feedback. If you don't want to share your idea, it's probably a bad one because someone else on earth is able to make it happen now, so you don't have any competitive avantage.
*   Don't worry too much about engineering, worry about getting users and customers first.
*   You're running a marathon, not a sprint. It's all about endurance. Focus on designing a good and valuable product which truly helps your customer.
*   Don't read to much books, do real business.
*   Strengthen the relationship with your co-founders. Don't go to bed angry. Be honest and open to each other.
*   Do one thing every day that scares you. Think about 3 things you need to do in the next 6 months to give your start-up the best chance of long-term success.
*   Relax, you gonna make mistakes, business is a game, even if it is serious.
