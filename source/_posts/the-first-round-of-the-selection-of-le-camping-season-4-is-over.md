57 startups from the 170 who have submitted their applications have been selected.

Our mission, now, is to spot the best 25 startups. For that, the Google hangout interviews that will start tomorrow are the perfect occasion to find out more about the teams, the ideas, the products, to double-check if all the founders are able to attend the program from beginning to end, to challenge their motivation, their spirit and their ability to show their passion for their product.

Le Camping kept the criteria used for the first round: a complementary team with an innovative and disruptive product or technology.

Along with 4 others mentors, for an afternoon, I have been assigned as an evaluator for 7 startups :

*   Lingocracy
*   The Faubourg
*   Sharenity
*   Znapp.it
*   Popp!
*   Blackbird
*   LearningShelter
The process will be the same for each interview : a 5 minutes pitch followed by a 10 minutes discussion. English will be used when an international mentor is present. We won't use the 6 stars system notation anymore. We are asked to show our feeling and urged to imagine we're gonna invest in those startups. Finally, we will have to say a YES or a NO and leave a comment to explain our decision to help Le Camping to choose the 25 winners for the next phase.

Stay tuned ...
