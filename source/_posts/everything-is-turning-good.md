It is a long time since I solved the puzzle in 5 minutes in the recreation yard to impress my friends.

A robot kit made of a Mindstorm NTX and controlled by a Samsung S Galaxy II comes to solve the Rubik's cube in 5.352 seconds. The smartphone broke the previous world record, established by Zemdegs Feliks, by 0.3 seconds. Will Gary Kasparov and Deep Blue change their jobs and meet the challenge ?

What was your personal best time ?
