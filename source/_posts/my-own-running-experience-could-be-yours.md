I enjoy running and hope I can help you to do the same. I would be pleased to help everyone interested in starting jogging, staying motivated, improving, and, why not, becoming a Marathoner.

Let me tell you my story, just to show you that nothing is never impossible.

I started running in 2007 when I was 40.

Within 3 years, I increased my speed by 4+ m/h (7 km/h) , lost some weight - 15 pounds (20kg), and enjoyed finishing my first marathon at 43, injury free , without any pain.

I don’t consider myself a runner guru. I don't have any secret techniques. That’s exactly the opposite of my purpose here. I want to show you exactly what I have been doing, from both my success stories and my failures, so that you can learn and be successful too.

I’m available to show you what I’ve learned so you can  have the tremendously satisfying and motivating experience of becoming a long distance runner.

Do believe me : everybody can.
