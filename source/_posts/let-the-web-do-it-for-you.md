The web is full of wonders. I discovered this morning a typical geek application and I wanted to share it with you.

That thing is called **ifttt**. It stands for "If This Then That." The promise of the creators is to "put the internet to work for you". They hold it.

ifttt can trigger actions by connecting chains to each other. 

In the first approach, the discovery of the thing reminded to me  my first twitter trials. I then registered without really understanding the ins and outs of the growing social network. Like twitter, after having got into details, ifttt turns out to be powerful and simple.

Let's give an example : suppose you want to save into your Dropbox an Instagram shot.

Let's connect to ifttt, activate the Dropbox and Instagram channels, say : "**i**f I take a picture with Instagram (**t**his), **t**hen do a backup in my Dropbox (**t**hat)". 

Done, it's easy, isn't it ?.

Ifttt offers free on the shelve recipes to automate actions between the 23 channels available today, enough to find something without having to assemble your workflow.

The comments section is wide open, tell us about how to effortlessly build powerful workflows . I will tell you in a forthcoming post how to enhance your personal productivity using ifttt.
