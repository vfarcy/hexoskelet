This morning, back from exercising, I glanced at my running logbook, back  in marsh 2010\.  At that time, I trained for the Paris marathon, the first marathon I ever trained for.

I had trained for eight weeks and completed about two-third of the three months long  plan. I wrote ,  the forthcoming two weeks will be rather intense, including speed and long distance exercising. The last two weeks, thus, will be much easier, without long workout, just jogging and some marathon specific speed parts.

I also mentioned in the logbook that I ran for 2 hours that Sunday, for 22 km, asking myself how I would keep up this effort twice as long.

Finally, I also took care paying attention to  the following points :

*   stay focused on the goal I had set : running the marathon in 3:45
*   check my daily nutrition and hydration
*   rest as much as possible

But most of all, I was concerned about breaking through the Wall. Do you know what it is ?
