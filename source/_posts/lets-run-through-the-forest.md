I had a great one hour run in the forest of Meudon. It was an opportunity to run about 8 miles through wooded paths, beautiful rocky climbs, descents, sometimes in the sun, sometimes in the shade of the trees.

I know a little about this forest, close to my office. So, I ran in the dark, with one thing in my mind, visit the place and make me an idea about the interest of training over there for the preparation of the eco trail scheduled in late March 2012, 80 KM with an arrival on the first floor of the Eiffel Tower, no less !

The conclusion is clear: the forest of Meudon, given its configuration is an excellent field for exercising. It now remains to find suitable training plan, but that's another story.

Hope to see you come across in a future workout.
