Do you know Le Camping ?

As part of Silicon Sentier, le camping brings to start-ups an intense, collaborative and ambitions program. It participates in the emergence of a highly innovative ecosystem in France.

Le Camping opened applications for Season 4 about 40 days ago. During this application period, many startups came to Le Camping to learn more about the program and experienced the environment that makes it so unique. About 100 entrepreneurs came to attend the Insiders Sessions that have been going on since December.

Today, I'm very happy to have been made an Evaluator of Le Camping Season 4 to evaluate 8 applications.

Phase 1 is scheduled from January 22th to February 5th.Thirty of Le Camping’s mentors and experts, and also Campers from seasons 1, 2 and 3, are assigned relevant applications based on our expertise and skills. Many are entrepreneurs, some are investors and others are experts in a particular field. This wide variety of skills makes for an excellent panel of evaluators.

Each application is reviewed by at least 3 evaluators and rated on a 6-star system based on 6 main criteria:

*   Level of  innovation,
*   Team,
*   Social proof,
*   Technology,
*   Ability to gain traction,
*   Product.
We, as evaluators, will add comments for the teams in order to provide them feedbacks.

Phase 2 of the selection process will start in 10 days. Stay tuned.
