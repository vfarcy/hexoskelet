A long time ago, more than one year, I played with and learned from a Google Labs product that was called "Google Scribe".

It was a wonderful and funny tool that helped me to autocomplete my writing in English. The completion was based on contextual and accurate searches provided by the powerful Google search engine.

It was not only a magical learning tool to improve my command of English. It was also a funny game to generate grammatically correct sentences that could be used to write whimsical stories.

At the beginning, Google scribe was a standalone product, part of Google Labs. It was then merged with Google's blogging platform. Unfortunately, Google scribe Suddenly vanished. Sadly, it hasn't been available for months.

Recent discussions show that Google scribe is missing many people from around the word. The truth that it autocompleted perfectly in English as well as in many other languages.

Do you have a free alternative in mind?
