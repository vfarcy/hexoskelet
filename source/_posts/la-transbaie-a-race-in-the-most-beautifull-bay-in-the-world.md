The Transbaie aims at being a big celebration.

Every year, between april and june, the race takes place at Saint Valéry Sur Somme, a small village in the “Baie de Somme”, France. That bay is classified by the UNESCO as one of the most beautiful in the world with the San Francisco Bay and the Mont Saint-Michel.

There is a particular spirit running the Transbaie : it’s a party for some runners who just attend for the beauty of the place. Nevertheless, that is not an easy race. Some people push hard to perform better than they did the previous year.

It’s really a unique experience crossing the bay at low tide, 10 km away from my birth place. As a teen ager, I would never have thought I would run it on day, waching the race at the local TV. Back then, I thought “Those people are so crazy”.

Twenty years after, I ran the Transbaie along with two former colleagues. I had started running for 1+ year . The IT services company a worked with, sponsored our running equipment.

I had a very simple goal : finishing. I enjoyed doing it and wish you could feel the same.![](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/articleobjectifmarathon/~4/QCMzGly9JP0)
