Every journey begins with a first step, goes on, and stops.

B. Luhrmann, S. Jobs and R. Pausch give us beautiful life lessons:

We are in 2005, Jobs had learned a few months earlier he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He wished to speak to students at Stanford University in California to tell them about his vision about life and how to make it meaningful. He also talks about his childhood, his education, his love for what he does despite the hardships he was able to pass through and overcome it. He also speaks of death. He concluded his speech with an invitation that I will do mine as well: "stay hungry, stay foolish".

This is a very touching farewell, a valuable life lessons from a man who had lived a full life. I teared up when he had the birthday cake placed onstage and got everyone to sing happy birthday toï»¿ his wife. And also that last thing he said that the message was for his 3 kids. And yet he inspired millions.
Thank you professor !
