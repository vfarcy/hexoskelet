I was overweight, tired, and honestly, felt incapable of running. My knees and my back hurt, I had been on medical leave and had worn a back belt for weeks.

I used to eat badly. I hadn&#8217;t  anything for breakfast, letting my wife and the children having it alone. At noon, hungry, I used to have lunch with colleagues. Every single day, I had salty and fatty meals : a starter, a main course, a dessert and wine.

Late in the evening, back home, I had junk food, picking up everything I could find in the fridge; cheese, delicatessen, french chips, chocolate.

During day work, I was spending most of my time in meetings, conference calls, in front of a computer writing documents and checking emails. I just exercised by walking from home to the station in the morning and back from the station to home in the evening.

As a matter of fact, I ate too much compared to my physiological spending.

I had fallen into this trap months after months, years after years and eventually became lethargic , breathless, probably depressed. I just celebrated my 40.

A Monday morning in April, while climbing the stairs heading to the station platform, I felt exhausted, even though I had rested all the weekend, sitting in the sofa, watching TV, thus cutting me off my family. I was heading the wrong way.

I then realized that things had to change and made the decision to break my diet habits and detox myself from unhealthy food habits. That Monday, on April, I made a very simple decision : to cut my daily ration, without going to a diet. I will tell you soon what I mean and how I achieved a lasting weight loss.

As a conclusion, if I could offer you a first tip it would be this  : **healthy eating is the very first step**. **If you are overweight, you should not run until you feel in shape. Do listen to your body**. Running is one of the most vigorous exercises out there but **you wonâ€™t lose weight by running only**, you need to watch what you eat.
