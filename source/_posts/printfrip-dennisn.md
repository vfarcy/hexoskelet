Dennis Ritchie MacAlistair was a computer genius and a pioneer of modern computing. With three other big names in the computer industry - Robert Metcalfe (inventor of Ethernet), Vint Cerf (inventor of TCP / IP) and Tim Berners-Lee (inventor of the web) - he laid the computer Basics today.

In the early 70's, dmr (his nickname from his e-mail) worked for Bell Laboratories. There, with Ken Thompson, he invented the C language, a technical revolution at that time. 

Forty years later, C and Unix are still the two most widely used technologies in the world. From Windows to Linux, from  Android, to IOS, from Mac OS to Snow Leopard, all modern operating systems are developed in C / C + + and based on the concepts Ritchie invented.  

Jobs gave us the iPhone, but Dennis Ritchie has opened the door to modern computing. In short, without him, the device on wich you are reading this post wouldn't have been, no less.
