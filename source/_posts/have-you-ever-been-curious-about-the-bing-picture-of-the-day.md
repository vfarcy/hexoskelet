I have been using Bing Desktop for a long time, enjoying the beauty of the wallpaper it delivers to my desktop each day. However, I needed to go a litle bit further, curious about the picture I glanced every morning.

Up to now, it was boring to search the web to get detailed information about the picture, ... until I eventually developped [this little thing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Ardb--ETL_YXdDF3WG9sWXdkTDRJTkl5dXAwSE9LZlE&gid=0 "About the Bing picture of the day").
