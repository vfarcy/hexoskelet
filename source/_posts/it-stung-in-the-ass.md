This is the quote by a buddy of mine, V, who ran Andresy (FR) half-marathon along with me this morning. He referred to the beautiful 4% slope, climbed twice. I negotiated the first ascent with dignity, while I only negotiated the second ascent, 30 minutes later, period.

V's legs, although still sensitive after he finished "La Diagonale des fous" 6 weeks ago, didn't prevent him from pushing faster than I had thought. We completed the race in 1:40, not so bad, only six weeks after his extraordinary performance on the "Diag", and close to my personal record.

The first half was run much more slowly than the second one, letting me the opportunity to discuss with V during the first 10 km about its ultra-trailer experience and motivation. By the way, I also got valuable advice for my forthcoming trail, by end of March 2012:

*   Never go in the red zone,
*   Buy a good pair of trails shoes,
*   Have good eating habits,
*   Rest,
*   Do slow long run while training, develop endurance.
I have made a short FPS movie about the race. Here it is :

Here's a 3D view of the race :

I am very happy to have run with my "buddy-coach"

Back home, I enjoyed eating good potatoes, cheese, meats and drinking fresh ros√© prepared by my housewives, just enough to have a deserved nap and recover from the 1683 calories I lost this morning !

Have fun, be healthy, stay hungry, stay foolish.

6u,
