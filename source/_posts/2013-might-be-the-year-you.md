2013 might be the year you won't leave things that matter unattended.

I urge you to take care of your loved ones. Too often, in the hurry or tumult of our stressful lives, our lack of attention generates misunderstanding and resentment. However, as understandable as it may be to let the stress of everyday life hinder relationships, it is never a good reason.

Too often we become accustomed to mistaking our daily occupations--our bread and butter, our business-as-usual lives--for things that really matter to us. Every day, enjoy following your passion; be confident, be wide open to others, don't forget to be available to yourself, be keen to engage, and go forward listening to your heart.

A few hours in advance, I wish you a happy new year 2013 in which we all turn towards things that really matter.

Have fun, be healthy, stay hungry, stay foolish.
