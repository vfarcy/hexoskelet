Back to the blog today, I did some maintenance and installed a new feature that allows me to write in Markdown from draftin.com and to publish in one click.

**Markdown**

This page has been created by entering Markdown, a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.

As [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/) writes on the [Markdown site](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/):
> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.
**Draft**

[Draft](https://draftin.com/) has been designed by [Nathan Kontny](https://twitter.com/natekontny) to bring writers what they really need. Draft is not only a distraction free online text editor that provides amazing features such as version management, team collaboration and transcription tools, all together in a sleek environment. Draft also features a special editing mode which is called "Hemingway mode".

"Hemingway mode" is about being focused on writing, by turning off the ability to delete anything in your document. In this mode, you can only go forward. You can't go backward. Editing and writing are two very different functions and one shouldn't pollute the other. It's difficult to write if you're in a editing mindset and removing more words than you're putting on the page.
