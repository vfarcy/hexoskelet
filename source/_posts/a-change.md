I have spent 20+ years in developing business in IT outsourcing, building service offering, driving SLA and profitability.

Focused on skill Management, business development and innovation, I like mid or long-term challenges, disruptive and ambitious projects.

I'm constantly looking for ideas to develop teams, to improve business through added value, to improve results, and the efficiency of the organization I work with.

After more the 20 years working with big IT services companies, I decided to bring this experience to the ESIEA, a Graduate School that provides not only high level engineering training but also develops the personal abilities of the students, giving them life skills that make all the difference and foster their full potential.
