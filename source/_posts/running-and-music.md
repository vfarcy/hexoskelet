**About running**
I started running in May 2007\. Today, running is part of my life. So, I decided to share about this tremendous experience. If you want to find out more about running, motivation, diet habits, mental preparation, goals setting and improvement, <del>feel free to join the Anima Sana In Corpore Sano community on Facebook, and don't forget to like it (if you do, of course !)</del>.

**About music**
Far from being a talented musician, I enjoy playing the piano and blues harmonica to develop my creativity, my dexterity, my breath,  my hear and to better understand what makes music so delightful to us. I let you appreciate how I have to improve my musical skills.
