I have never been asked who my running competitors are. I don&#8217;t have any.

It is not because there’s nobody else running around there. My neighbourhood is full of runners. It is not because I’m not aware of other long-distance runners. I know many of them. It is  not because I&#8217;m the most talented. I&#8217;m definitely not. It is not because I live in a small and closed world. I don&#8217;t.

Actually, there are three reasons for that. Let me tell you more.

&nbsp;

**Competitors are potential teachers, not competitors.**

There is always opportunity to meet people stronger than you, eager to teach you about their habits, their training tips, their routine, so that everyone achieves much more than he could succeed alone. This brings everyone a long-lasting, beneficial and profitable friendship.

I&#8217;m not saying I don&#8217;t consider and don&#8217;t take an interest in others runners performances. I like to see, to challenge and to debate. I do take every meeting as an efficient way to learn or a tremendous opportunity to improve. In return, I welcome everyone interested in learning or improving.

**Except for a very few talented people, there’s not enough time to be the best.**

There are only so many hours in the week and I don’t have enough time worrying about running against other runners. I prefer running with them, or for them.

The running space as so many opportunities that there is enough room for everyone. To get defensive takes your attention away from reaching your own goal in a positive way.

I’d much rather spend my energy and time building something useful and positive than lose my energy and time worrying and being defensive about how long or how fast they run.

**My main “competitor” is &#8230; myself.**

I don’t concern myself with competitors because I’ve always been much more interested in beating my earlier performance than beating somebody else’s.

When I started running, four years ago, I felt the same way, and I still feel. I remember keeping a log file of my workout, always aiming to gradually increase my speed while keeping a steady hearth frequency.

You can only improve yourself if you know yourself.

The benefit of competing against yourself and not other people is that you’re always attempting to keep the momentum moving forwards, you never become stagnant. When you compete against others,  you’re given an excuse to take your foot off the accelerator if they go backwards or even give up. There is always a record to break when you’re competing against yourself, yours.

What’s your attitude towards your fellow runners ?
