I [told you](http://farcy.me/blog/dear-larry-dear-tim-will-you-work-together "Dear Larry, dear Tim, will you work together ?") recently about my Nexus 7 troubleshooting when connected to the iPhone.

I explained that the tablet randomly flashed,brought me back to the slide lock screen, restarted,and went well for a short time until the screen locked again.

Weird indeed.

While waiting for Larry and Tim's response, I played around with the Nexus and the Iphone, trying to fix the bug.

I had the tablet in a case when the bug was happening. Don't tell my why, I eventually took the Nexus out of the case, and ... it didn't do it anymore. I tried to replicate it out of the case, but I wasn't able to, so I put it back in the case and tried to replicate it, and yes, same issue again.

Now, I am not 100% sure that it is the case. Could the magnetic built-in power off system of the snap case disturb the device ?

I will be playing around with it a bit more to see what else causes this issue.
