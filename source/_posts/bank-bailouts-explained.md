Sometime, cartoons explain the world we  live in better than the news we listen to !

Did you hear about the bailouts?
- No. What about the bailouts?
The government has announced the taxpayers will make money on the bailouts.
- Should I believe them?
Depends. Do you believe the politicians are honest?
- No.
Do you believe the bankers are fair?
- No.
Do you believe that the 2 plus 2 equals pink?
- No. I definitely do not believe that the 2 plus 2 equals pink.
Than you should not believe we'll make money on the bailouts.
- But how could the government claim such a thing?
By conveniently ignoring the backdoor bailouts.
- What is a backdoor bailout?
A backdoor bailout is like any other bailout, except the government lies and say it wasn't a bailout.
- But what was the main bailout?
The main bailout was the tar-pee program.
- What is the tar-pee program?
A program where the government used the taxpayer dollars to buy the shares in the banks.
- Why did they buy the shares?
Because they said the banks were too big to fail, and if they failed,there would be too many foreclosures and no new mortgages.
- So after the government bought the shares, did the banks stop the foreclosures?
No.
- Did they give the mortgages?
No.
- So what did they do with the money?
They used it to buy other banks.
- But werent they already too big to fail?
Yes.
- So now they are too biggerer to fail?
Exactly.
- Which banks are too biggerer to fail?
The biggest are the JP Morgan Chase Bear Sterns Washington Mutual,and the Bank of America Countrywide Merill Lynch.
- What about the Goldman Sachs. Did they buy another bank?
No.
- Why not?
Because when you already own the US government, you don't need to buy any more banks.
- After the other banks became too biggerer to fail, did they stop the foreclosures?
No
- Did they give the mortgages?
No
- Did they do anything at all?
One executive at the bank of America countrywide merill lynch paid the bill on his 70 thousand dollar desk.
- My god. Is this a corrupt third world country?
Definitely not.
- How could you be so sure?
Because nobody in a third world country would be stupid enough to spend 70 thousand dollars on a desk.
- Is this executive still at the bank of America Countrywide Merill
Lynch?
No. He is now the CEO of the C I T.
- What is the C I T ?
The C I T is a failed lending company.
- How could a failed company hire a new CEO?
Because they also got billions in the bailouts.
- Do these people have no shame?
When you constantly get the bailouts, you don't care about the shame.
- What was the main backdoor bailout?
The biggest was the bailout of the AIGs.
- Why did they bailout the AIGs?
Because the AIGs owed billions to the banks, and if they went under the banks would lose too much money.
- And after the bailout, how much did the banks lose?
Nothing
- How is that possible?
Because the government decided the taxpayers should pay for all the banks mistakes
- Which bank did the AIGs owe the most money to?
The Goldman Sachs.
- So despite its poor decision to do too much business with a failed company, the Goldman Sachs did not lose a penny?
Actually, the Goldman Sachs probably profited from the failure of the AIGs.
- How could someone profit from the downfall of one of their biggest business partners?
Because while the Goldman Sachs was working with the AIGs, it was also making a secret bet that they would go under.
- My god, is this some kind of science fiction movie, like the star wars?
No.
- How do you know?
Because the evil empire in the star wars was fiction. But the evil empire that is the Goldman Sachs is very real.
- But weren't the American people outraged by this manipulation of a bailout?
At the time, the American people did not know about the structure of this bailout.
- How come?
Because the government ordered the AIGs to lie to the people.
- Who in the government gave such an order?
The New York Fed.
- And who at the time was in charge of the New York Fed?
The Timothy Geithner.
- And who put the Timothy Geithner in charge?
The Timothy Geithner was appointed by the President Bush.
- What about the President Obama, and the change. Did the President Obama bring the change to the Timothy Geithner?
Yes
- So he fired him?
No. He promoted him to treasury secretary.
- That does not sound like the change we can believe in.
Definitely not.
- Were there any other bailouts?
Yes. During the financial crisis, the Ben Bernank loaned trillons of dollars to companies like the barclays.
- What is the Barclays?
The barclays is a european bank.
- Why would the Ben Bernank lend money to a European bank?
So they could buy the Lehman after it went bankrupt.
- And why did the Lehman go bankrupt?
Because the Ben Bernank refused to lend them any money.
- But why would the fed refuse to lend the American peoples money to an American bank, but then lend the money to a european bank?
I dont know, maybe because the Europeans have funny accents.
- But me and you also have funny accents. will the Ben Bernanke lend us money?
No
- Why not?
Because we are not bankers, and to the Ben Bernank if you are not a banker, then you simply don't exist.
- So after all these bailouts, did the banks stop the foreclosures?
No.
- Did they give the mortgages?
No.
- Did they do anything at all?
They paid themselves big bonuses.
- That does not sound like a prudent use of the American peoples money.
When you constantly get the bailouts, you don't care about the
prudence.
- Are any of the bailouts going on today?
Yes. The Ben Bernanke keeps the short term interest rates at zero.
- How is that a bailout?
Low rates mean the banks have to pay the American people very little interest in their savings accounts.
- That is a very nice gift from the American people to the banks.
Yes.
- And to show their gratitute, did the banks stop the foreclosures?
No
- Did they give the mortgages?
No.
- Did they do anything at all?
Yes. They increased the monthly fees on all bank accounts.
- That does not sound like the gratitude. That sounds like the screwing of the American people.
Yes.
- But isn't it normally a bad idea to screw your own customers?
When you constantly get the bailouts, you don't care about your customers.
- But after all these different bailouts, what did the banks do
with the money?
They invested a lot of it in the foreign countries.
- Why did they invest in the foreign countries?
Because they said in America the taxes are too high.
- Why are the taxes so high?
Because the government is broke.
- And why is the government broke?
Because they spent all their money on the bailouts.
- Is this all some kind of a sick joke?
Yes, in a way, it is.
- What kind of joke is it?
Well, do you work for a bank?
- No.
Did you get any of the bailouts?
- No.
Do you pay income taxes?
- Yes.
Then the joke is on you.
